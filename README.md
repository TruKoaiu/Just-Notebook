<p align="center">Notebook app that focuses on simplicity and only essential functionality, to not distract your day-to-day use.</p> 
<h2 id="started">🚀 Getting started</h2>
<strong>1. Java 17+ Required</strong></br> This app requires Java 17 or higher installed on your PC.

</br> <strong>2. Download the App</strong></br> Navigate to the "FINISHED" folder. There you will find both the `.jar` and `.exe` files. </br> </br>
<strong>3. Running the App</strong></br> - With Java installed: Run either the `.jar` or the `.exe` file.
It will create a "notes.db" file that will serve as the database for your app, so keep it in the same location as your app.</br> </br>
<strong>4. If you encounter any issues, feel free to contact me.</strong> </br>

<h2 id="code">🔟 Code</h2> This code works without lag and feels sufficient for a project of this type. </br></br> This project was almost scrapped two times (deleting around 80% of the code each time), before I settled on using plain JavaFX. The code may include some old, unused functions or other elements that shouldn't be present anymore. </br></br> I know that it's not the best, but I won’t be changing it in the near future, as I have too much on my plate with college, work, student committees, and other projects. </br></br> I apologize if the code feels unreadable or doesn’t hold the best structure, but from what I know, it works, doesn’t produce bugs, and isn’t slow. </br>

The icon used for the app is an item 'Book and Quill' from the game Minecraft. </br>
This app will never be put for any commercial usage, so until the policy change and won't allow the usage of this image I will probably leave it like this.
